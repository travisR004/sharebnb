Re-creation of vacation rental site Airbnb.com. Created a single page app using backbone and RESTful API design.  Integrated Google Places API to autocomplete search bar, as well as a map view to display results.  Wrote an equation to determine which listings fall within the map view at every zoom level. Wrote custom queries to handle rental approval requests to prevent overlapped bookings.  Created an intra-site messaging system for users to coordinate travel plans.
